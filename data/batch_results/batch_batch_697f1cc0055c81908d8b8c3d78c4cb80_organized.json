The blue color is not due to the blood itself, which is actually red, but rather how our eyes perceive the light that is refracted through the skin. \n\nREASONING: The skin absorbs more red light and reflects blue light, making veins appear blue to our eyes. Additionally, the depth of the veins beneath the skin and the scattering of light contribute to this optical illusion."
